# OCR-Image

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process of extracting text from images or scanned documents. In Python, you can use the pytesseract library, which is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR engine, to perform OCR and extract text from images.

Before you start, make sure you have installed Tesseract OCR on your system. You can download it from the following link: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
